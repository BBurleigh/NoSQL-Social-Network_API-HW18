# NoSQL-Social-Network_API-HW18

## Description 
---
Aside from being the NoSQL assignment, we were to practice using a combination of Mongoose and Express to create a very rough social media API. Since there is no front end code for this, the code for the routes, controllers, and models is entirely comprised of JS. 

## Installation
---
The following commands will need to be run in the user's terminal, with the exception of the last one, which is a program:

1) npm i --> to download necessary modules

2) npm start --> run local server

3) Insomnia --> test get, post, put, and delete

## Demo Video
---
A demonstration video of the app's functionality is provided below.

## Usage 
---
In theory, a user can test whether some of the basic functions of their social media API were working, such as creating new users and posts, adding reactions to those posts, updating posts and current users, as well as deleting users and posts/reactions.

## Credits
---
Aside from my instructor and T.A., my tutor as well as a few people at AskBCS assisted me in better understanding the creation of the models and adjusting the routes and controllers.
